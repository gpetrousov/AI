## Graph coloring problem solved by Min-conflicts and Tabu search algorithms written in python2. ##

###Usage###
Just run the starter.py and follow the prompts.

	python starter.py
Will run all the algorithms in sequential order.


###Files

**starter.py**
  
- This runs all the functions in sequential order.

**minconflicts.py**

- Implements the Min-conflicts algorithm.

**tabu.py**

- Implements the Tabu search algorithm.


### How?
- The program reads the graphs from the graphs folder. 
- The first number in the first line tells how many colors are available and the rest of the numbers are the colors.
- The second line tells how many nodes are in the graph.
- The third line tells how many edges there are in the graph.
- The rest of the lines contain the connecting nodes. For example

    	 0 19 <>

	means that node 0 is connected with node 19, the "<>" is omitted. 

- Note that the graphs were already provided, I did not generate them.
